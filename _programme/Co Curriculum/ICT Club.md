The Northoaks ICT Club enriches the students’ learning experiences by providing them with opportunities to express their thoughts and ideas. These opportunities involve students in projects and competitions.

The club provides training in Coding, Drones Programming and Videography.

**Coding and Drones Programming**

Students in the ICT Club learn to use the Scratch coding software in Primary 4. They gain the knowledge of different programming functions and create simple coding sequences. &nbsp;In Primary 5, the students learn to programme drones using the Swift Playground application. Using the application, students learn to programme the flight sequence before syncing it to the drones to check the accuracy.

**Video Production**&nbsp;  

Students also learn video production skills. At Primary 4, students are introduced to a variety of technical skills using the iPad. They also learn the fundamentals of post-production using the Video Maker Software which is available in the Windows 10 suite. As they progress to Primary 5, students learn to use DSLR cameras. Students are encouraged to explore different ways to present their ideas. The students’ creativity is further developed in Primary 6. &nbsp;Students work together in groups on a video project to reinforce their video production skills. Students learn the importance of collaboration through the training activities.
