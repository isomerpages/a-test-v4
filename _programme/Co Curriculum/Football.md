**About**
<br>Football is a sport that provides experiential opportunities for students to develop a strong character that portrays perseverance, determination, discipline, resilience and teamwork which are aligned to our schoolâ€™s H.E.A.R.T values. Through the guidance and expertise of our dedicated and experienced coaches and teachers, we aim to develop the passion for football in our young players.&nbsp;

We do not only focus on developing and honing football technical skills of our players, such as dribbling, passing, tackling and football strategy, but also to develop them into responsible leaders and&nbsp; active contributors to the society.
