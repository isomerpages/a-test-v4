### ICT Curriculum

The ICT Baseline Standards form the basis of the ICT curriculum. Students will acquire skills such as basic typing skills and will also learn how to use Microsoft Office software such as Word, Powerpoint, Excel and Movie Maker.&nbsp;

To enrich students' learning experiences in the classrooms, teachers tapped on the affordances of ICT tools. The school adopts the active learning process and plans ICT-infused lessons across the curriculum. Through the active learning process, the school aims to equip student with the skills and dispositions to be self-directed and collaborative learners.
