Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.<br><br>

The school introduced the Northoaks Olympics to inculcate the Olympic values of Respect, Friendship and Excellence in all our students through games and sports. The Olympic values are also in line to the school’s H.E.A.R.T Values and students are encouraged to display them in their daily lives. All students recited the Northoaks Olympic Oath before the start of the school’s Olympic Carnival.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Active Recess@ Northoaks</strong></p>

The school embarked on the Active Recess programme in 2017 to encourage students to play during recess. The programme gives students the space to interact and play with their friends. In the initial year, students are able to loan PE equipment, such as the skipping rope and the hula hoop. This year, the school has expanded the playing space and loan equipment. Besides, allowing the students to play Basketball at the court, Frisbees and Football are allowed at the school field. In the near future, the school hopes to provide a wider range of sport equipment for students to borrow. Apart from giving the students an avenue to enjoy themselves, we hope that they students can continue to practise the skills that they have learnt during PE lesson. Ultimately, the school hopes that students will have the necessary knowledge and skills to lead an active and healthy lifestyle when they leave the school.
