### The Northoaks Art Curriculum:

<br>

**Young Artists' Programme**

<br>

_A Journey in Artistic Exploration....._

Here in Northoaks Primary School, we believe that every single child has the innate ability to create, enjoy and appreciate art. Most important of all, we believe that everyone has the potential to develop into passionate &amp; confident young artists. This is why we call our art curriculum the&nbsp;**_Young Artists' Programme_**.&nbsp;

Taking reference from MOE's new 2018 Art Syllabus, our art modules are based on the 3 broad focus areas of 'Self&nbsp;_and Immediate Environment', 'Singapore in Past, Present and Future' and 'The World and the Region We Live in'._&nbsp;For each of the modules, students draw inspirations from (MOE-approved) artworks by local and international students and artists and learn art history &amp; theories, and media ranging from oil pastel, paint to ICT art, and create their own artworks.

The Young Artists' Programme aims to develop students with:

i)&nbsp;**Visual Inquiry Skills**&nbsp;to discover and explore their surroundings.

ii)&nbsp;**Confidence**,&nbsp;**Curiosity,**&nbsp;~and~&nbsp;**Imagination**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Enjoyment**&nbsp;in art making and art discussion.

iii)&nbsp;**Awareness**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Respect**&nbsp;for histories and cultures of key&nbsp;**Artworks**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Artists**&nbsp;in Singapore and the World.

The following are the themes and topics for each of our art modules.

### The SchoolARTS@SCH project

  

The SchoolARTS@SCH project started in 2019 with&nbsp;14 schools and has seen a steady increase in the&nbsp;involvement of different schools since then.&nbsp;Our Primary 4 students contributed 15&nbsp;artworks to one of the Singhealth Community Hospitals.

  

The Singapore Community Hospitals are&nbsp;Bright Vision Hospital, Outram Community Hospital&nbsp;and Sengkang Community Hospital. These&nbsp;hospitals use artworks to beautify&nbsp;their lift lobbies and common corridors.

  

Please view our students' artworks in the [virtual art gallery](https://www.artsteps.com/view/622b02f1c4bc55e6c124af17)

**HEARTbeatz@NKPS**

Northoaks Primary School&nbsp;has a structured&nbsp;**whole-school approach**&nbsp;to implement its aesthetics learning through its 6-year progressive Music Modular Programmes entitled, HEARTbeatz. With this in mind, the objectives of HEARTbeatz are:  

*   To support the&nbsp;**holistic development of students in the Aesthetics domain**&nbsp;through Music Appreciation

  

*   To allow students to learn&nbsp;**Handchimes, Angklung and Ukulele skills**&nbsp;and to appreciate pitch, rhythm and beats through the learning

  

*   To equip our students with&nbsp;**Social Emotional Learning (SEL)**&nbsp;and to reinforce the school values&nbsp;of&nbsp;**‘H.E.A.R.T’**&nbsp;(Honesty, Empathy, Appreciation, Respect, Tenacity).
