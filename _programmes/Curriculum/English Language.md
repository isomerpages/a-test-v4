### English Curriculum  

The English Department adopts the STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning And Reading) 2.0 approach in the teaching and learning of English language. STELLAR 2.0 aims to strengthen students’ foundation in both receptive and productive skills and knowledge of the language through:

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explicit teaching of grammar

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explicit teaching of oracy skills

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explicit teaching of critical and close reading skills

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthening the reading-writing connection, taking into account the purpose of texts

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ringfencing one period for Extensive Reading

For lower primary, each unit is structured across 2 weeks and taught in 3 stages:  

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Book Approach (SBA) 1: where children read a storybook (big book) with the teacher and engage in oral discussions with teacher and peers

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA 2: where students are taught explicitly grammar, oracy skills, critical and close reading skills, and engage in class writing, group writing and individual writing through the Modified Learning Experience Approach (MLEA)

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differentiated Focused Lessons (DFL): which include word study lessons to strengthen word recognition skills, one reading period set aside each week to promote extensive reading and other extension activities

**Active Reading Programme**

The Active Reading Programme is a joint initiative between the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and English Language (EL) Departments, and is implemented by the Active Reading Committee. It aims to instill the love for reading and promote the appreciation of languages. It is also our aim to provide our students with greater access to books, and motivate them to read widely. This year, we have launched five activities – ‘Reading under the Stars (RUTS)’, ‘Mobile Library @ Foyer’, ‘Pre-loved Books on Wheels’, ‘Eat-a-Book’ and ‘Storytelling’, which are targeted at building the reading culture in our school. In addition to these activities, we have also introduced and guided students to navigate online portals to access e-books and resources from the National Library Board (NLB) and the School e-Resource Repository (SERR).&nbsp;

**Reading under the Stars (RUTS)**

Reading under the Stars is an annual school event held to encourage our Primary One students to read extensively in both the English and MTL. It also aims to promote parent-child bonding through reading. This year’s theme “Express Yourself” aimed to get our children to find creative ways to share their feelings, thoughts and ideas about themselves. Students and parents were treated to a book-sharing session by local author J.H. Low, as well as storytelling sessions and hands-on activities conducted by our teachers. Though it was conducted via Zoom this year due to the pandemic, students enjoyed themselves and it was heartening to see their bright smiles on the screen.
