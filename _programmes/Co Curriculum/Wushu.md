Wushu&nbsp;is a full-body workout which helps to improve students’ overall fitness. The gradual process of stretching enhances their flexibility. The physical exercises improve their coordination ability, as well as to gain more strength and better stamina.

However, Wushu is more than just a sport. During trainings, values such as respect, patience and tenacity are emphasized to develop students’ character which will&nbsp;guide their behaviour in all aspects of their life.
