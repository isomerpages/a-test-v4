**About**

The Environment Science Club was established in January 2017. It is made up of environment enthusiasts who champion the school’s efforts in conserving the environment within and beyond the school. In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Environment Science Club forms the Eco-schools committee. The team is engaged in learning and tackling real-life environment issues such as recycling of waste, conservation of water and energy and cultivating biodiversity in the school.

Opportunities such as assembly talks, energy and water campaigns and celebration of World Water Day are provided for the team to raise awareness in students on man’s impact on the environment thereby encouraging them to play their part in conserving the environment. The club also conducts sharing sessions to engage the community beyond the school in recycling projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Students are also tasked to engage the community to promote upcycling and work towards Environment sustainability. Our members have been advocating Environment education to members of the public through various engagements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2019 Community Outreach Programmes**

The Environment Science Club hopes to engage our community in the efforts to sustain our environment. They value every opportunity to communicate with others on the shared goal of making our environment sustainable. Some examples of our outreach programmes are listed below:

  

**Tray Return Campaign @ Kampung Admiralty**

Environment Science Club student ambassadors have collaborated with the CCE department to partner with NTUC Foodfare to reach out to the community at Admiralty’s hawker centre to promote and educate the residents on the importance of self-tray returning.![](/images/env01.png)

**2019 Earth Day @ Marina Barrage**

Environment Science Club members participated in the annual EarthFest held in Marina Barrage. During this outreach, our members were able to promote Northoaks’s environment education as well as educating members of the public. Some of our members got a chance to present their learning to their family members as well.

**2019 Canberra Day @ Sembawang**

Environment Science Club members&nbsp;and student helpers from the Friend of Singha project (CCE, ViA) were invited by Sembawang GRC to promote Northoak’s environment education. Both groups used recycled materials to promote Northoaks’s upcycling efforts. Our Eco-team leaders were actively educating Sembawang residents on how to upcycle plastic bottles into a “self-watering” garden. One of our student ambassadors showed Dr Lim Wee Kiak (MP for Sembawang GRC) our upgraded version of “self-watering” garden. They innovated the bottled garden using Design Thinking protocols in their creation.

**2019 Hosting China Schools in collaboration with NEA**

Environment Science Club has collaborated with NEA to co-host visitors from China. Students presented on Northoak’s Environment Education confidently to the visitors from the four visiting schools. The visitors also shared their school’s environment education with us. After the sharing, our student ambassadors took the visitors to tour our school environment and thereafter co-hosted an upcycling workshop to the staff and students from China.
