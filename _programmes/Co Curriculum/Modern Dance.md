**About**

The Modern Dance CCA aims to nurture and groom students to excel in the area of dance. Through exposure to various dance genres, the CCA strives to spark passion in our young dancers and achieve high standards in our dance performances. During dance trainings, students learn to express themselves through dance and translate their inner feelings to body movement. Besides these, they also learn the value of tenacity and the importance of teamwork in order to perfect their dance routines.

**Achievement**

Our dancers took part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation for International Dance 2020, where they presented a Contemporary Jazz piece and was awarded the&nbsp;**_Certificate of Accomplishment_**.&nbsp;
