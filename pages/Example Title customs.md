# How to Lodge Guarantee 

You can lodge the guarantee in the form of a Banker’s Guarantee, Finance Company Guarantee or an Insurance Bond.

You are strongly encouraged to apply for the guarantee with any of the participating financial institutions on the eGuarantee@Gov programme. Please refer to [eGuarantee@Gov ](http://www.eguarantee.gov.sg/) for the full list of participating financial institutions.

When you lodge the guarantee via the eGuarantee@Gov programme, you would not need to collect the hardcopy guarantee from the bank and bring it to Singapore Customs. The financial institution will send it electronically to Singapore Customs, saving you time and courier costs.

**1) For new applications**

			<p>For eGuarantees: If you had previously applied for an e-Banker’s Guarantee (eBG) under Singapore Customs’ Electronic Banker’s Guarantee Programme, and wish to extend the validity of your eBG, you can similarly approach the bank that previously issued the eBG, to extend it through the eGuarantee@Gov programme. To extend, simply:</p>
			<p>1. Quote your existing Bank Guarantee reference<br>
			       2. Indicate the new expiry date<br>
					   3. Inform the bank that you wish to extend your guarantee under eGuarantee@Gov programme, with template reference “CUSTOMS_REG"</p>
			<p> Once the eGuarantee has been received and successfully registered by Singapore Customs, we will send an email notification to the primary and secondary contact registered in your entity’s Customs Account as per the current notification process.</p>
			<p> NOTE: The procedure above only applies for cases where you are amending the eGuarantee expiry date only. If you are amending the amount to be lodged, you will have to apply for a new guarantee.</p>
