# End to end test repo for IsomerCMS
This repo is meant to provide an empty repo for engineers to run end-to-end tests on. 

## Initial state of repo
This repo contains no collections, no files, and no resource room to start off. The initial pages are the default ones created as follows:
- Pages
  - contact-us.md
  - faq.md
  - privacy.md
  - terms-of-use.md
- Images
  - favicon-isomer.ico
  - hero-banner.png
  - isomer-logo.svg

Note that tests for resource room creation must be done manually - once a resource room has been created on the CMS, there is no way to remove it.
